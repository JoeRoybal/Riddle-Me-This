***CAUTION: SENSITIVE INFORMATION***

What is the Megaphone? A school newspaper that produces factual knowledge
and information for the entire campus to enjoy and read? Or is it something more
sinister? A group of persons whose jobs is to coerce the student body into a series of
brainwashing treatments to create the next New World Order to fight off the current
cabal living under the Denver airport. I have it under good authority that this
organization is extremely clever and with crafty penmanship can change the mind of the
average reader with a simple paragraph. These carefully selected writers are chosen
based on their superior handiwork with the mighty pen. This new organization is just the
start of something big that will soon engulf most of the midwest by early 2021.
The current New World Order uses a method of manipulation called chemtrails,
which is the trails left behind aircraft during flight. I'm not saying all of those trails are
chemtrails, but there are a few. The chemtrail consists of multiple chemicals in their
dangerous mixture, but the main ingredient is LSD. This is used for a multitude of
reasons. Among the most popular are; creating a “smokescreen” of lies for certain
events in certain areas as cover ups for experimental UFO testing done by various
governments and brainwashing. If a town is tripping balls on LSD and reports a
multitude of sightings in a night then the real sightings of the experimental UFOs go
unnoticed. As for the brainwashing, the town must be subjected to the chemtrail and the
media outlets are fed a story that the organization wishes the general population to
believe. These tactics have been used since the late 80’s and will be continued until
they are exposed.
How does this pertain to the “Megaphone” you may ask? Using special ink in
their news papers which is composed of the same type of chemicals used in the
chemtrail on plains, the “Megaphone” can then slip in its own subliminal messages that

can be used to convince the reader who has just come into contact with said chemicals.
What is the importance of these convincing chemicals used in the papers? Only they
truly know…
As for the actual organization, I wasn't sure they even existed at first… I have
been by their office many times and never have I seen anyone in that dark room. I had
to see for myself if this was a front for something bigger. I had infiltrated one of their
meetings under an alias to protect myself. The meeting seemed pretty believable by all
regular meeting standards, and the group seemed really nice. But they might just be
pawns in a much larger game (or lizard people hiding craftily in plain sight), the fight for
a new New World Order. A secret battle fought among some of the highest elites, since
this can easily be covered up with their immense influence I wouldn't expect to hear
about it.
If their plan is to become the next New World Order then that means they would
need a main headquarters like the current New World Order has in the Denver airport.
Where would said secret base be located? I am glad you asked because if you have not
yet realized that there is being some construction being done on the Fondren Jones
Science Center. This is where I believe the mass production of the chemtrail chemicals
will be held and the students don't know what they are creating their own demise. Pretty
soon the campus will be acting as drones in a hive network with the Megaphone as the
queen bee. As students graduate they will be put out into the world to help spread the
influence and when new students come in they will be initiated in to a world of secrecy.
This clever plan has been in the works for years to come and needed the funding to
create an expansion to the FJS which will accelerate their timeframe.

“But paper is dead. No one reads the paper, it’s all online.” you might say. Don't
let this fool you, because it didn't stop them. These well written articles on the website
and be carefully crafted around pixels that only your subconscious can pick up leaving
these messages to stir in the back of your mind only to have you think of them later.
This is considered a concept under the mainstream name “Inception”, but the truth is
that it is in fact not a concept at all. Yes, like the movie. If only they knew how close to
the truth they were. I am surprised it made it to production and wasn't shut down by the
head honchos. The movie of Inception is close to the real thing since the idea is
implanted into the subconscious, but they missed the delivery (slightly). Inception is
possible through subliminal messaging in tvs, electronic billboards, computers, and of
course smartphones. These messages can be seen with a polarized lens rotated 90
degrees under a mixture of infrared light and a black light, but only on CRT(Cathode
Ray Tube) television. This is because with the invention of newer displays it phased out
the only way of detecting the messages, which was the point. These messages are
being used to incept ideas into the heads of the readers and is far more effective and
cheaper than the use of chemtrail chemicals. The use of this technology is nearly
undetectable and is easily implemented. Don't even get me started of the hidden
messages in the pictures posted to social media.
As for going into people's dreams, I believe it is being attempted by an
underground group of ex USSR spies children. The concept is to play different
frequencies into your ears from your phone while you sleep in order to change the tone
of your dream, once streamlined they can fabricate their own dreams and mass produce
the frequency. This is why I always take my phones battery out when I sleep, to protect
this vault of valuable information stored in my head. When you head those high pitched
tones in your ears make sure to take the phone battery out to stop the transmission of

data and keep your mind safe. I believe the research is being funded through various
shell account out of the Cayman Islands that lead back to the new New World Order
that is being founded by the “Megaphone”.
 The world is changing and we are at the center of it.
